# Expandia Brand Visual Guidelines

This document serves as the master source of truth for all visual assets generated for the Expandia brand. ALL artificial intelligence models (Midjourney, DALL-E, Flux, etc.) AND human designers must adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure brand consistency.

## 1. Core Aesthetic: "The Digital Hive"
**Concept:** A fusion of Swiss precision/governance and high-efficiency European execution.
**Keywords:** Connectivity, Operational Speed, Warm Efficiency, Geometric Harmony, Infrastructure.

## 2. Color Palette
The brand relies on a high-contrast, professional, yet vibrant palette.

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Primary** | *#fde382
#fde384
#fee485
#fde480
#fee27e
#ffe284
#fdd34d
#fde585
#fee27f
#fee281
> **⛔ DO NOT USE:** Neon greens, bright reds, or cool cyans unless specifically required for a status indicator. Avoid gradients; prefer solid flat colors.

## 3. Illustration Style: "Flat Vector Architecture"
All illustrations should look like high-end, flat vector art suitable for a modern SaaS or Enterprise Service website.

### ✅ DOs:
*   **Style:** 2D thick bold vector arts 
*   **Lines:** Clean, sharp geometric lines.
*   **Shapes:** Distinct architectural outlines (skylines, office blocks) and organic hexagonal patterns (honeycomb grids).
*   **Composition:** Wide, open compositions with plenty of white space.
*   **Metaphors:** 
    *   *Flight Paths:* Dashed yellow lines connecting points (representing logistics/data flow).
    *   *The Hive:* Subtle hexagonal grids overlaying or integrating with cityscapes.
    *   *Bridge:* Connecting the "Swiss Side" (Mountains/Grossmünster) to the "Execution Side" (Modern Offices).

### ❌ DON'Ts:
*   **No 3D:** Do not use realistic 3D rendering, shiny textures, or ray-tracing effects.
*   **No Abstract Chaos:** Avoid undefined "tech blobs" or messy generative art.
*   **No Photography:** These guidelines apply to *illustrations*. Photos should be high-quality, authentic office shots if used.

## 4. Master Prompt for AI Generation
Use this prompt as a base for generating consistent assets:

> "**Uniform flat vector illustration.**  
> **Style:** Clean, geometric flat design. No gradients, no drop shadows, no 3D rendering.  
> **Colors:** Primary **Bumblebee Yellow (#FFD700)** and **Dark Charcoal (#1F2937)** on a **White** background.  
> **Subject:** [INSERT SUBJECT HERE]  
> **Details:** Incorporate subtle hexagonal patterns or dashed flight path lines to imply connectivity.  
> **Vibe:** Professional, efficient, Swiss-quality, warm."

## 5. Typical Subjects
*   **IT & Security:** Shield icons constructed from honeycomb segements.
*   **Sales:** Yellow flight paths connecting varied business districts.
*   **Team:** Diverse professionals in charcoal suits with yellow accessories (ties, notebooks) collaborating around hexagonal tables.
*   **Global Layout:** A stylized map where cities are nodes in a hive network.
