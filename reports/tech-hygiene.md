# Technical Hygiene Status

## Done
- Canonical/OG/Twitter aligned to `https://www.expandia.ch/...` on updated pages (lead scoring SaaS, cross-channel, pipeline generation, sales agent Europe, outsourced sales management, homepage, solutions).
- Sitemap already points to `https://www.expandia.ch/blog/lead-scoring-saas-complete-guide.html`.

## Next Actions
- Add hreflang triplets (en/x-default, de, tr) to top blog posts and key service pages where missing.
- Confirm redirects: enforce https + www; 301 duplicate blog variants (e.g., cross-channel complete vs main) once canonical decisions are final.
- Optimize media: compress hero images; ensure lazy loading for non-critical assets to improve LCP.
- Validate Article + FAQ schema with Rich Results Test after each batch.
