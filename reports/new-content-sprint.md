# New Content Sprints (3–5/week per priority cluster)

## Week 1 Ideas (EN)
- ABM: `account-based marketing playbook Europe 2025` – frameworks + budget tiers.
- Forecasting: `sales forecasting accuracy framework` – models with downloadable template.
- CPQ: `proposal templates and CPQ checklist` – emphasize AI automation vs classic.
- Pricing: `value-based pricing in EU B2B` – region-specific examples.
- Outbound: `advanced cold email frameworks (A/B sequences + triggers)`.

## Localization Pipeline
- Localize proven EN pieces to DE and TR with native copy, localized stats/examples, and hreflang mapping.
- Maintain per-locale titles/meta; avoid direct translations of “guide/complete”.

## Format / Schema
- Each piece: title ≤60 chars, meta ≤155 chars, 3–4 FAQ Q/As, Article + FAQ JSON-LD, hero image, breadcrumbs.
- Add internal links to homepage, solutions, relevant blog cluster pages with intent anchors.

## Target Output (first 2 weeks)
- 6–10 EN articles + 4–6 localized (DE/TR) versions of highest-performing topics.
