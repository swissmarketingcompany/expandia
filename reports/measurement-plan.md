# Measurement & Iteration Plan

## Weekly (every Monday)
- Pull GSC by page/query for EN/DE/TR; track clicks, impressions, avg position, CTR. Segment by priority clusters (lead gen, cross-channel, pipeline, CPQ, sales agent).
- Flag pages with position ≤8 and CTR below benchmarks (≥5–7% pos 3–5, ≥2–3% pos 6–8, ≥1% pos 9–10).
- Note wins from updated titles/meta; duplicate patterns to similar pages.

## After Each Publish/Update
- Validate canonical, hreflang, Article + FAQ schema (Rich Results Test).
- Submit URL Inspection for fast re-crawl.
- Annotate GA for content releases.

## Biweekly
- Check internal link coverage to priority URLs (homepage, solutions, blog index, related posts).
- Review bounce/LCP on blog template; compress heavy hero images if LCP >2.5s.

## Reporting Format
- Table: Page | Locale | Clicks | Impr | Pos | CTR | Action (keep/iterate/merge/301).
- Track experiments: Title/description variants and FAQ additions with date stamps.
