# SEO Baseline and Targets

## Current Signals (from provided GSC snapshot)
- High impressions with low clicks across EN/DE/TR; CTR typically <2% on many blog guides.
- Homepage and key service pages show similar pattern (e.g., `/` 62 clicks / 3.1k impressions; `/b2b-lead-generation-agency.html` 1 / 645).
- Multiple near-duplicate topics (cross-channel, pipeline gen, AI forecasting) and locale variants (`/`, `www`, `http`, `/tr/`, `/de/`) likely splitting CTR.

### Top Opportunity Pages (impressions >300, clicks <10)
- Lead scoring SaaS guide, cross/multi-channel lead gen guides (several variants), sales agent/outsourced sales Europe, CPQ/proposal guides, pipeline generation guides, ABM, pricing/AI/prioritization guides, homepage, solutions/service pages, TR/DE landing pages.

## Targets (next 90 days)
- Reach ~10k organic clicks/day by stacking: +3–4k/day from CTR lift on existing high-impression pages; +3–4k/day from new/optimized content; +2–3k/day from localization (DE/TR) and link-driven boosts.
- CTR goals by position: ≥5–7% at pos 3–5; ≥2–3% at pos 6–8; ≥1–1.5% at pos 9–10.
- Language split targets (initial): EN 60%, DE 25%, TR 15% of daily clicks.

## Priority Clusters (per locale)
- EN/DE/TR: lead gen, outbound/cold email, pipeline gen, ABM, sales ops/forecasting, CPQ/proposal, pricing, marketing automation, international expansion, services (agency/solutions/appointment setting/case studies/contact).

## Data Gaps / Next Pulls
- Fresh GSC export by query + page per locale (last 28–90d) to confirm positions and pick top 30 pages (pos ≤12, high impressions).
- GA to confirm landing-page sessions vs clicks and identify bounce/LCP issues on blog template.

## Next Actions
- Map queries→URLs to remove cannibalization and set one primary keyword per page.
- Apply standardized CTR blocks (title/meta/FAQ schema) to top 20 pages first, then roll out.
- Add internal links with intent anchors from homepage/solutions/blog index to these priority URLs.
